/**
 * This is very tricky bug fix for Angular 4-8 versions. The only thing we do here
 * is just override the `Location` subscription and wrap `scheduleNavigation`
 * into `ngZone.run(...)`, thus `routed` components will be created inside Angular's zone.
 * The main issue is `back/forward` buttons of browsers, because they invoke
 * `history.back|forward` which dispatch `popstate` event. Since `single-spa`
 * overrides `history.replaceState` Angular's zone cannot intercept this event.
 * Only the root zone is able to intercept all events.
 * See https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-angular/issues/94 for more detail
